Challenge: Terminal Quest

Today you will be practicing your terminal skills with a fun quest! Using only
the terminal, enter the magical world of Bashlandia. You will find a message 
waiting for you from King Tux which will tell you what you are seeking. 

Navigate through the world using the terminal, completing the tasks along the 
way as you find them. Anytime you come across a .py file, run it with

$ python <filename>.py

Note you may have to run the file again after you complete the task it contains!
Each task will involve a specific terminal command - consult the cheat sheet
to find the one that's appropriate.
