My good wizard,

I write to you with ill tidings, for a terrible calamity
has befallen my kingdom. My magic parrot has gone missing! 

As you know, my parrot has for years maintained an aura of frivolity and
good cheer throughout my kingdom. Each year at the Festival of the Parrot,
the people would sing and dance throughout the night. But on the eve of this
year's festival, I discovered that my parrot had gone missing! The festival
was cancelled, and my people have become depressed. My talented jesters and 
musicians have failed to elicit even a single laugh or funky dance move.

Now in desperation I turn to you. As one of the most powerful wizards in the
land, I believe that only you can find my magic parrot and bring him back home.
If you are unsure where to start, seek out the witch of the Enchanted Forest.
Her ways are mysterious, yet she may be able to help.

Please help me, for you are my only hope.

Yours faithfully,
King Tux
